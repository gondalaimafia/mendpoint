# Mendpoint GA review

- [x] Confirm `main` and `origin/main` are at `8725ba4`.
- [x] Map the GA delta from `b843e0e` through `8725ba4`.
- [x] Audit API, authentication, and production controls.
- [x] Audit platform, harness, SCM, RBAC, and sandbox paths.
- [x] Audit graph learning, persistence, and incremental paths.
- [x] Audit CI, packaging, web status, and operational readiness.
- [x] Run build, typecheck, tests, and GA checks.
- [x] Validate every candidate finding against exact source lines.

## Review

Review outcome: do not treat `8725ba4` as production ready.

- The API aborts before listening because `@mendpoint/db` re-exports missing registry symbols.
- The web production build and monorepo typecheck fail.
- API key identity is discarded in favor of caller supplied role and tenant headers.
- Unsigned public webhooks and public GitHub App mutation routes can change state.
- Platform isolation, harness result reporting, SCM failure handling, and incremental graph deletion have release blocking defects.
- `npm test` and `npm run ga:check` pass, demonstrating that the current CI gate misses deployable artifact failures.

## GA remediation

- [x] Create a dedicated remediation branch.
- [x] Restore API startup and fix all root type errors.
- [x] Bind RBAC and tenant identity to authenticated API keys and enforce scopes.
- [x] Require signed production webhooks and protect GitHub App mutation and inventory routes.
- [x] Add a safe first key bootstrap path.
- [x] Remove host shell injection and false VM isolation.
- [x] Preserve harness failures and propagate live SCM errors.
- [x] Fix capped incremental deletion and graph model/query consistency defects.
- [x] Make the production image self contained and writable.
- [x] Add root tests, build, typecheck, authenticated API startup, and container gates to CI.
- [x] Add regression tests for every reviewed failure path.
- [x] Run full tests, typecheck, build, authenticated API smoke, and GA verification.
- [ ] Verify both container targets in GitHub Actions.
- [x] Review the final diff and commit without unrelated changes.

## Remediation review

Local verification is green:

- `npm test`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run ga:check`, including 20 of 20 graph benchmark cases
- Production API bootstrap and startup with `API_AUTH=required`
- Authenticated `/keys` request returns 200
- Invalid API key and unsigned production webhook each return 401
- CI and Compose YAML parse successfully
- CI startup smoke passes Bash syntax validation
- `git diff --check`

Docker is not installed in the local environment. The CI container job now builds
both the `api` and `web` targets, so that check remains open until the branch run
completes.
